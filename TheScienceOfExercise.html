      <h2>What Happens in Your Body — Cell by Cell</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>1. Muscle Fibers</h3>
        <p>Lifting weights causes small microtears in your muscle fibers. In response, your body sends nutrients and satellite cells to rebuild the tissue stronger and thicker. This is how real muscle is made.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>2. Nerve Cells</h3>
        <p>As you train, your brain learns how to send better signals to your muscles. These nerve improvements help you lift more, even before your muscles grow. It's called neuromuscular adaptation.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>3. Epithelial Cells</h3>
        <p>The cells that line your blood vessels and skin adapt to the increased blood flow and friction. Your vessels become more resilient, and your skin may form calluses for protection.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>4. Bone Cells</h3>
        <p>Weight-bearing exercises activate bone-building cells (osteoblasts). Over time, your bones become denser and stronger, reducing your risk of injury or osteoporosis.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>5. Fat Cells</h3>
        <p>Training increases your energy needs. Your fat cells respond by releasing stored energy — shrinking in size when your nutrition supports the process. This helps with metabolic health.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>6. Blood Cells</h3>
        <p>Exercise boosts your body’s need for oxygen and repair. Red blood cell production increases for oxygen delivery, while white blood cells rise briefly to support recovery.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>7. Stem Cells</h3>
        <p>These are your body’s all-purpose repair crew. Lifting weights activates muscle-specific stem cells that help build and strengthen tissue for the long haul.</p>
      </article>

      <div class="summary-block">
        <h3>In Summary</h3>
        <p>Resistance training transforms your body at every level — from muscles and bones to nerves and fat cells. You're not just lifting weights; you're upgrading your entire biology.</p>
