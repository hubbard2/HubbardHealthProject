      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m Luke Hubbard, a senior at the University of Notre Dame currently in the process of applying to medical school. My passion for preventative medicine, personal health, and behavior change has driven me to launch this project to help adults take control of their physical health and long-term independence. I belive, that more often than not, exercise and good habits can replace pharmacological solutions or major surgeries. I believe that this is actually not emphasized/implemented enough in medicine because there is less incentive for the pharma and healthcare businesses. I want to do what I can to face the problem head-on without just talking about it, however, limited by time I can only speak my thoughts and hope that you hear what I am saying and try to make practical changes until they work (because eventually you will find a way to make them work). Current healthcare workers often do a poor job of talking about all the options that a patient has and instead often implies to the patient that they have one option. I am here to say this is not the case, but the solution has to start right now. You have to work on the solutation before the problem comes because the problem will come, everyone dies, everyone loses muscle if they are inactive, everyone will face health issues in one sense or another.</p>

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>I believe that some for of resistance training should be in every single individuals life, with almost no exceptions. Why? Because it’s the most evidence-backed method for improving strength, metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and more. It also helps prevent the chronic diseases that undermine quality of life in later years.</p>
      <p>This isn't about just losing weight to look better. It is true that weight and diabetes is one of the biggest predictors of health problems and an increase in the chances of all cause mortality. Many people don't realize that diabetes is a continuum it isn't your diabetic or not you fall somewhere on a line and your habits and behaviors are what you can do to directly change where you fall. A big goal is increasing <strong>healthspan</strong>: living your last 10–20 years with freedom and capability — not in a chair or hospital bed, not intellectually gone, but strong enough to pick up your grandkids and walk independently.</p>
      <p>I choose to make this my mission not because resistance training is the single best thing you can do for your health, but one of many things that are essential to your health and this is where I believe I can make the most difference because there are often many barriers that keep people away from the gym that simply shouldn't. I know that I am in a great position to help minimize all of these barriers, like being intimidated from the gym, not knowing how to use the gym, not able to be consistent (lets be honest it is hard to discipline yourself sometimes), unsure about the need and benefits that it can provide in your individual life, etc.</p>

      <h2>The Truth</h2>
      <p>If a pill existed that could give you strength, protect your bones, improve cognition, fight chronic disease, and burn fat — you’d take it. That pill is resistance training. Thoughtful, simple, consistent strength work for your body.</p>
      <p>The best thing you can do in your situation if you are inactive or only do light cardio, like walking or pickle ball, is to start consistently going to the gym and working to build muscle or doing more difficult cardio that can also help build essential muscle (even though it is focused more on reducing fat and cardiovascular health). However, you have to be brutally honest with yourself, if you have tried and are not consistent you need to look for help. The first place you should look for help should be your friends and family. If someone in your close relationship is very active and takes good care of their body you need to pick up some habits from them and do some activites with them. The truth is social pressure is one of the best motivators to maintain your health you just have to put yourself in the right situation. Personally, I would have never picked up weight training or running if I had not been taught the habits from someone else and pushed through the difficult exercises with a little competetion or support from my buddies. Now, if you are in a certain situation where it is difficult to do acitvites with your friends and family or you don't have the social circle then you need to reach out and I can help you.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Since launching, over 5,000 people saw the announcement. Due to time constraints I was able to work with four initial clients.These clients enrolled and improved strength and confidence — while giving $50–$150 each to charities. That’s real proof of value and impact.</p>

      <h2>What’s Next</h2>
      <p>You have two paths:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start now on your own. Get in the gym. Use the machines. Keep it simple, stay consistent.</li>
        <li>If you have tried or know you won’t — and many don’t — then reach out for help from me. I cost money, yes. But I bring coaching, clarity, and accountability. It's a small investment with huge lifelong returns. Also, all of the money is directly going to a good goal of helping others in the same path.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is the Hubbard Health Project. It's not a gimmick — it's a launchpad for lasting change.</p>
